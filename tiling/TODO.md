# TODO list

 - [x] GPU mask rasterization (fragment shader, ssbo).
 - [x] CPU mask rasterization fallback.
 - [x] Opaque tile occlusion culling.
 - [x] Experiment with basic multi-threading support.
 - [x] Solid color pattern.
 - [x] Try to send quadratic b√©zier curves to the GPU and flatten them in the mask rasterization shader.
 - [x] Support multiple atlas textures.
 - [x] configurable atlas texture sizes.
 - [x] Option to merge consecutive solid tiles.
 - [x] Custom patterns
 - [x] Tiled image patterns.
 - [x] Simple linear gradient patterns.
 - [x] Support storing gpu data without SSBO
 - [ ] Image patterns.
 - [ ] Custom masks
 - [ ] Support rasterizing masks with static loops
 - [ ] mix tiled and non-tiled draws
 - [ ] Overlap the row decomposition and row processing stages when running in parallel.
 - [x] Fix the CPU rasterizer code path.
 - [ ] Rasterize CPU masks asynchronously.
 - [ ] Stroke mask shader (round joins/caps).
 - [ ] Use SIMD instructions for the CPU rasterizer's prefix sums.
  - Encode rasterized masks in column major (flip it back in the copy shader).
  - do N rows at a time (one per SIMD lane), each with their own prefix sum.
 - [ ] Try a cheaper quad flattening algorithm (knowing we generate few segments most of the time).
 - [ ] Compress the curves sent to the GPU.
 - [ ] Better upload paths (write data directly into mapped gpu buffers).
 - [ ] Compute shader version for the rasterization and compositing.
 - [ ] See if there are benefits from doing multiple quads per instance.
 - [ ] Axis-aligned rectangular clips.
 - [ ] Clip paths.
 - [ ] GPU tiling (compute shaders).
 - [ ] Support for combining masks
 - [ ] Get a demo working on top of GL without ssbos.
